# üìä Understanding Price Elasticity Segments and Strategies
we need a price data to anlyze the price of a product over time The dataset contains transactional data from a retail business, including information about the prices charged by the business (Price), the quantity of items sold (Item_Quantity), and the prices charged by competitors (Competition_Price). The dataset also includes other relevant fields such as Fiscal_Week_ID, Store_ID, and Item_ID, which allow for grouping and analyzing the data across different time periods, locations, and product categories.

## In the analysis, products were categorized based on how their sales respond to price changes:

- Negative Elasticity: Quantity sold decreases when price increases (typical demand behavior).
- Unitary Elastic: Quantity changes proportionally with price changes.
- Highly Elastic: Small price changes cause large shifts in quantity sold.
- Zero Elasticity: Quantity sold remains constant regardless of price changes.
