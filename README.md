In the analysis, products were categorized based on how their sales respond to price changes:

Negative Elasticity: Quantity sold decreases when price increases (typical demand behavior).

Unitary Elastic: Quantity changes proportionally with price changes.

Highly Elastic: Small price changes cause large shifts in quantity sold.

Zero Elasticity: Quantity sold remains constant regardless of price changes.
